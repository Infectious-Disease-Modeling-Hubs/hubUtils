```

An important function of `hubUtils` is allowing for the connection to data in the `model-output` directory to facilitate extraction, filtering, querying, exploring, and analyzing of Hub data.

# Structure of hubverse datasets

All data returned from connecting to and querying hubs can be read or validated as a `model_out_tbl` which is an S3 class defined by the `hubUtils` package. A `model_out_tbl` is a long-form [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) designed to conform to the [hubverse data specifications for model output data](https://hubdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format/model-output.html). In short, the columns of a valid `model_out_tbl` containing model output data from a hub are:

 - `model_id`: this is the unique character identifier of a model.
 - `output_type`: a character variable that defines the type of representation of model output that is in a given row.
 - `output_type_id`: a variable that specifies some additional identifying information specific to the output type in a given row, e.g., a numeric quantile level, a string giving the name of a possible category for a discrete outcome, or an index of a sample.
 - `value`: a numeric variable that provides the information about the model's prediction.
 - `...` : other columns will be present depending on modeling tasks defined by the individual modeling hub. These columns are referred to in hubverse terminology as the `task-ID` variables.

Other hubverse tools, designed for data validation, [ensemble building](https://infectious-disease-modeling-hubs.github.io/hubEnsembles/), [visualization](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/hubVis), etc..., all are designed with the "promises" implicit in the data format specified by `model_out_tbl`. For example, [the `hubEnsembles::linear_pool()` function ](https://infectious-disease-modeling-hubs.github.io/hubEnsembles/reference/linear_pool.html) both accepts as input and returns as output `model_out_tbl` objects.

# Hub connections

There are two functions for connecting to `model-output` data:

- `connect_hub()` is used for connecting to fully configured hubs (i.e. which contain valid `admin.json` and `tasks.json` in a `hub-config` directory). This function uses configurations defined in config files in the `hub-config/` directory and allows for connecting to hubs with files in multiple file formats (allowable formats specified by the `file_format` property of `admin.json`).
- `connect_model_output()` allows for connecting directly to the contents of a `model-output` directory and is useful for connecting to appropriately organised files in an informal hub (i.e. which has not been fully configured with appropriate `hub-config/` files.)

Both functions establish connections through the [`arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/) package, specifically by opening datasets as [`FileSystemDataset`s](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/Dataset.html), one for each file format. 

Where multiple file formats are accepted in a single Hub, file format specific `FileSystemDataset`s are combined into a single `UnionDataset` for single point access to the entire Hub `model-output` dataset. 
This only applies to `connect_hub()` in fully configured Hubs, where config files can be used to determine a unifying schema across all file formats. 

In contract, `connect_model_output()` can only be used to open single file format datasets of the format defined explicitly through the `file_format` argument.


```{r setup}
library(hubUtils)
library(dplyr)
```

## Connecting to a configured hub


```{r}
hub_path <- system.file("testhubs/flusight", package = "hubUtils")
hub_con <- connect_hub(hub_path)
hub_con
```

To access data from a hub connection you can use dplyr verbs and construct querying pipelines.

```{r}
hub_con %>%
    filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
    collect()
```

Note however that not all dplyr filtering options are available for all data types yet.

You can see how in the above output the required `model_id`, `output_type`, `output_type_id` and `value` column names are all present, as is required for a `model_out_tbl` object. However, the output of the above expression, while conforming to `model_out_tbl` convention, is actually returned just as a `tbl_df` or `tibble` object.

For example, if you wanted to get all quantile predictions for the last forecast date in the hub, you might try:

```{r, error=TRUE}
hub_con %>%
    filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
    filter(forecast_date == max(forecast_date)) %>%
    collect()
```

This doesn't work however as `arrow` does not have an equivalent `max` method for `Date[32]` data types.

In such a situation, you could collect after applying the first filtering level which does work for arrow and then finish the filtering on the in-memory data returned by collect.

```{r}
hub_con %>%
    filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
    collect() %>%
    filter(forecast_date == max(forecast_date)) 
```

Alternatively, depending on the size of the data, in might be quicker to filter the data in two steps:

1. get the last forecast date available for the filtered subset.
2. use the last forecast date in the filtering query.

```{r}
last_forecast <- hub_con %>%
    filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
  pull(forecast_date, as_vector = TRUE) %>%
  max()


hub_con %>%
    filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US",
           forecast_date == last_forecast) %>%
    collect()
```



## Connecting to a model output directory

There is also an option to connect directly to a model output directory without using any metadata in a hub config file. This can be useful when a hub has not been fully configured yet. 

The approach does have certain limitations though. For example, an overall unifying schema cannot be determined from the config files so the ability of `open_dataset()` to connect and parse data correctly cannot be guaranteed across files.

In addition, only a single file_format dataset can be opened.

```{r}
model_output_dir <- system.file("testhubs/simple/model-output", package = "hubUtils")
mod_out_con <- connect_model_output(model_output_dir, file_format = "csv")
mod_out_con
```


```{r}
mod_out_con %>%
    filter(output_type == "quantile", location == "US") %>%
    collect()
```


When connecting to a model output directly, you can also specify a schema to override the default arrow schema auto-detection. This can help at times to resolve conflicts in data types across different dataset files.

```{r}
library(arrow)

model_output_schema <- schema(
  origin_date = date32(),
  target = string(),
  horizon = int32(),
  location = string(),
  output_type = string(),
  output_type_id = string(),
  value = int32(),
  model_id = string()
)

mod_out_con <- connect_model_output(model_output_dir, file_format = "csv",
                                    schema = model_output_schema)
mod_out_con
```

Using a schema can however also produce new errors which can sometimes be hard to debug. For example, here we are defining a schema with field `output_type` cast as `int32` data type. As column `output_type` actually contain character type data which cannot be coerced to integer, connecting to the model output directory produces an `arrow` error. 


```{r, error=TRUE}
model_output_schema <- schema(
  origin_date = date32(),
  target = string(),
  horizon = int32(),
  location = string(),
  output_type = int32(),
  output_type_id = string(),
  value = int32(),
  model_id = string()
)

mod_out_con <- connect_model_output(model_output_dir, file_format = "csv",
                                    schema = model_output_schema)
```

Beware that `arrow` errors can be somewhat misleading at times so if you do get such a non-informative error, a good place to start would be to check your schema matches the columns and your data can be coerced to the data types specified in the schema.
